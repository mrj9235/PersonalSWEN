Start
Estimated Time 00 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
I will implement the methods in the order that they are given in the text file.  
Testing will be done using the given tests and then implementing my own tests that are
required.


Complete
Actual Time    00 38
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

At first i forgot to .upcase! the strings that would be passed into the functions.
This would cause my code to error out because it was trying to access members of a nil array.
Overall the methods were pretty simple to write and pretty repetitive.
