================================================================
Start activity 1 -- complete and test the Line class in line.rb
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
My plan is to implement the length method and then write a few tests to see if it works,
then I plan on runnin git using the command line to see if it works every way.
Complete
Actual Time	00 40
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

The method itself was very easy to implement, the thing that was most difficult was writing the 
test class from scratch, I had to look at all of the older projects to know what to do for the test class.
The test cases also took a while because I didn't know exactly what to test.

================================================================

Start activity 2 -- complete and test the Circle class in circle.rb
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
I plan on implementing them in the order that they are given to us, that way i can use previous methods in
the one i am currently working on.
Testing will be testing each method and making sure that they work.
Complete
Actual Time	00 15
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

The circle class was pretty easy to implement if you knew all of the proper formulas.

The test cases again is what took the majority of my time.
================================================================

Start activity 3 -- complete and test the Rectangle class in rectangle.rb
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
I again plan on implementing them to in the order that they are commented.  I also plan on looking at the previous
classes to make sure that I am fully aware on how the methods should look.
Tetsing will be making a test for each method and seeing if they work.
Complete
Actual Time	00 40
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

I had a bit of trouble trying to call the height and width methods for the perimeter and area methods.
I still actually don't know if I did it properly but I got it to pass all of my tests.

**UPDATE** I got the rectangle class to work properly, added 5 minutes for a total of 45 minutes
