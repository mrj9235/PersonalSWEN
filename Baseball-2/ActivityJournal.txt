Queries 1 through 10:
Estimated Time	02 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
My plan is to implement them one by one.  After each one is written the way I think it'd be
correct I am going to compare it to the Output given by just looking at the given output in
the write up.  If it works I will move on, if it doesn't, I will keep trying until it does.

(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

The only problems that I encountered where when the query required us to search for titles
that started with a word.  We'd never done that before so it took me a while to find it on google and use it properly.  The query that took me the longest was number 8.

Estimated Time	01 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
I plan on implementing as many as possible before the due date
Testing will be comparing them to the output provided

I ended up only being able to implement two but they were both fairly easy to 
figure out and worked the first time.
