SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name:Meghan Johnson

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	02 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
My plan is to implement the methods in the order they are given to us.  This is because they are dependent on the other functions.
My plan for testing is to run test_find until all tests pass and use the debugger if necessary
Complete
Actual Time	01 45
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
I learned how to use pointers a bit more properly during this activity.  I still messed up some, but was able to fix it.
About 3 of the times that I tried to compile, the core dumped and I had to go back to the planning board
Other Compiling errors were stupid mistakes like forgetting a parenthesis or forgetting a curly brace.
I only had one runtime error and that was when I forgot to increment a value in a while loop so the loop went on infinitely.
