C Health Monitoring System Project - Part 2

Name:Meghan Johnson

===========  Stage 1  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	02 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
I will implement this first by implementing addPatient and then go onto the main function in health.c
Testing will be done by trying to check in the patient and the printing out the patient's ID and making sure they match.
Complete
Actual Time	01 30
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
The longest part of this part was figuring out what the structs actually stood for and how to properly used them.
After figuring out how to use the structs figuring out the rest was pretty simple
===========  Stage 2  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time 01 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
 I plan on implementing most of the functions in health_util
and then implementing what needs to happen in the main function in part two.
My approach for testing will be similar to part 1.  I'll enter code that is given in the examples for
part 2 and then add print statements

Actual Time	01 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

Updating the main function wasnt bad, it was just calling one function.
The things that took the most time were implementing 3 of the util functions.
I then wrote A while loop to bprint out each buffer and their nexts each time one was called
This was just to check to make sure everything was linking correctly

===========  Stage 3  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 10
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
I believe that from the beginning I had properly implemented my method to keep going with multiple lines of input
and being able to store more than one patient at a time.
I will test by writing a simple while loop that prints out the patients.
Complete
Actual Time	00 05
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
My code worked perfectly with what had to be done in this stage.  The five minutes included writing a print
statement and making sure everything linked together properly.

===========  Stage 4  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
I think that this will be longer than others because now I have to add in the health data
This means I have to implement "addHealthReading" as well as implementing cases 1-6 in my
switch statement in health.c
Testing will be done with the sample input and seeing if it works with the output properly
Complete
Actual Time	02 30
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

I messed up the way I passed in the time to addHealthReading.  This cause me to worrk and go
through everything to see what I had messed up.  A pro of doing this was I found an error in one
of my other functions.  Another place I messed up was I used the wrong index variables in my
print statements and this also caused me to panic

===========  Stage 5  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 05
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
If I am correct, I believe that I properly implemented my code in level four to also work with
What stage five is asking us to do.
For testing I will run it with the sample input they give us and I will check to see if the
output looks correct
Complete
Actual Time	00 03
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

I ran the test and the output looked exactly like it should have.
===========  Stage 6  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 05
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
As I stated in level five I believe that I overthought stage four and my implementation then 
Should properly work for stage six as well.  The only problem that I have right now is that
when I enter multiple lines of input at once, if the input with type seven isn't last or by itself, it gets really weird
and doesn't look like the proper output
Complete
Actual Time	00 03
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

I ran the test and the print statement saying that there were patients being added didn't
looked messed up like they had before.  It passed the test
===========  Stage 7  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)

I plan on implementing two functions, one that deletes just the health data and then
another one that deletes all the health data and then frees the patient chart.

My testing approach will be to run through the input that was given to us at the beginning of the write up

Complete
Actual Time	01 30
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

The main problem that I encountered was trying to get the next of a NULL.
It was because of my conditions and after I added an extra if statement it worked fine.
===========  PROJECT SUMMARY REFLECTION  =======================
(Replace this text with a couple of paragraphs summarizing your
experience with this project. What is too easy or too hard? What
was the most challenging technical problem you faced? How
did your estimated and actual time compare? Did your estimates
improve as you advanced to later stages? Why or why not?)

This project was at first a bit harder than I expected.  This was
mostly because of the structs and having to learn how to follow them and put things into them 
properly.  After stage 3, The project became very easy, especiallu since I accidentally coded my stage three to work with the rest of the stages up to stage 6.
Stage 7 became a bit more tricky again, but that's because I don't have the most experience
with malloc and free.  The most challenging probelm I faced was just trying to understand
how to work with the structs.  I found myself mistyping a lot or forgetting what struct had what.
I got the hang of it eventually but it was a pain.  My times were pretty close to my estimated
times.  As I went on the ratio got a lot better and evetually even got below 1, unfortunately
it went back up for stage 7.
