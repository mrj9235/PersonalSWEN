Part 1
Estimated Time	01 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
	I plan on looking through the code and understanding how the rest of the program works
	instead of just jumping in and trying to code it blind.  After this, I will write the program to the
	best of my abilities before trying to compile and fixing any errors.
	Testing will be running the program with the tests that are provided.
Complete
Actual Time	03 30
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Each time I compile there is just a warning saying that result is not used in a test funtion. 
I definitely over estimate my ability to code in c as my estimated times are no where near the actual time
At first, I didn't realize that you had to insert the characters into the array, I thought it was already filled
with the line, so I was iterating through nothing.

Part 2
Estimated Time	02 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
I will implement the copy function to the best of my ability and then I will change it bit by bit until it works
the way that it is supposed to.
Testing will be putting it through my own tests while it is compiled as longest, and then use the provided tests

Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
I learned that c is a bit more picky than I though.
Everytime I compiled there were no errors, however there were runtime errors that took a while to fix.
The problems that I encountered were remember cases for if statements
