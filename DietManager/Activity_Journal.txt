================================================================
Level 1 – Food DB Load – Start
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan for this level:
 I plan on implementing the main constuctors for FoodDB and BasicFood.
I then plan on implementing the main function that will create the database from the textfile
and then take in commands.

Create unit tests
Level 1 – Food DB Load – Complete
Actual Time	00 50
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

problems that I encountered were my print statements printing out a list of nils
This happened because I forgot quotes around what i put after puts.
I also forgot to but the variable a few times and that caused some errors.

Time Ratio 50/30
================================================================
Level 2 – Print & Find – Start
Estimated Time	00 30
Plan for this level:

I plan on implementing print and then find.  Testing will be attempting to test the output
that the functions produced.
Level 2  – Print & Find – Complete
Actual Time	00 15
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
This level was pretty easy, I had no problems whatsoever when working on these commands

Time Ratio: 15/30
================================================================
Level 3 – Database Update – Start
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan for this level:
I plan on implementing them in the order that the write up says.
I also plan on writing a test for each method

Level 3 – Database Update  – Complete
Actual Time  03 30	
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
This level gave me a lot of troubles.  I had many problems writing into the file.
Everything kept overwriting everything.

Time ratio 03 30/ 01 00
================================================================
Level 4 – Logging Foods – Start
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan for this level:
I plan on implementing both of the log classes and then implementing the two three other methods in order

Level 4 – Logging Foods – Complete
Actual Time	01 30
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

I had a lot of problems working with the dates and I still don't exactly know how to properly sort the show all dates
My brain also stopped working and I completely lost track of what I was supposed to do and stared at an
empty nano file for about 10 of these 90 minutes

Time Ration 90/60
================================================================
Level 5 – Show & Delete – Start
Estimated Time	01 00
Plan for this level:

I plan on implementing them again in the order that they are written in the write up

Level 5 – Show & Delete – Complete
Actual Time	00 45
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

There were not really any problems that I faced other than figuring out that I had to write a to_s for my dates.
I also made a stupid mistake and split up the wrong string and that messed up my delete function for a while

Time ratio: 45/60
================================================================
Overall Summary
Estimated Total Time	04 00
Actual Total Time	06 50
Project reflection:

This project all-in-all was easier than healthnet part 2 in my opinion.
The Classes were easier to keep track of and overall the code was cleaner.
The only thing that i had a true problem with is the amount of time I spent googling things 
because I had basically no idea what to do for a certain class(ie date).
This became very tedious but I was able to work it out.
Overall I had a lot of fun with this project,
