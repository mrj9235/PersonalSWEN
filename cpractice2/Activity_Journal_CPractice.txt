C pointers light Practice Practicum

================================================================
Overall comments on:

Amount of description in the cpractice2.c file:
	There was a good amount of information in the descriptions in the file.
	They were very clear to follow and they were very helpful.
	Each description basically matched the description on the website except the first one.
Amount of description in the webpage:
	There was a very helpful amount of descriptions on the webpage.
	The review at the bottom of the page was also very helpful and was look at a lot.

General comments:
	A general comment I have is about the tests.  The testing messages were kind of helpful in some functions.
	However, it would be more helpful if it stated what the output should have been and what the output our
	function made was.  That way we can compare both.

================================================================
get_pointer_at_position
Actual Time	00 05
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

No problems encountered, pretty standard funciton to get an index.
================================================================
convert_and_sum
Actual Time	00 40
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

I tried out a strategy that was way more difficult than what the actual solution was.
I tried setting a variable called y and setting that to the pointer value time m + b.
I didn't realize that you can just manipulate the value of the pointer.
================================================================
same_array
Actual Time	00 10
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

This took a bit longer because again, I tried something a lot more difficult than what the
solution was.
I tried comparing each value instead of just comparing the memory locations.
================================================================
bool_flip_flop
Actual Time	03
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

This one was really easy, just had to set a global variable and see if it was odd or even.
================================================================
fix_bad_code
Actual Time	10
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.

this one took a little bit longer because I had to get the index of the last letter properly
It was pretty easy thought to fix the code that was given to us
================================================================
