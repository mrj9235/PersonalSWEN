Estimated Time	03 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
My plan is to implement the three functions one at a time and then compile them to see if there are any errors.
Testing approach is to use the provided tests to see if it all works.
I will look online to answer any questions that I might have on syntax or built in c functions.

Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
First Attempt at Compiling:
	It didn't compile.  It is confused about the reference of test in the main method, which isn't
	really my fault.  I even tried to compile it under the name 'test' and got the same compile error.
	It was my fault, I didn't compile it correctly 
I still don't consider every condition and I need to start doing it more often.
