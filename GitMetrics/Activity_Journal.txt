SWEN-250 Activity Reflection
Ruby - Git Repository Metrics

Name: Meghan Johnson

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
My plan of implementation will be to first learn how to do what the project wants us to code.
Once I refresh my memory on standard input and parsing, I will go through and make it so that
my could should maybe work, make it definitely work, and then clean it up.

My testing approach is going to be using the original test cases that the file already gives us 
and then making more test cases.

Complete
Actual Time	02 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

Probelms that I encountered were properly adding things into the array in num_developers, and then 
properly handing how to return the time.

I learned that instead of using array.insert(), you can just do array += value

writing test cases were pretty easy
