================================================================
Start Part 1
Estimated Time: 01hr 30min
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
My plan is to write out what code I think will work as this is my fist time
Coding in C, and then I will try to compile and run the program.
There isn't exactly much testing since the function doesn't
take in any variables.

Complete
Actual Time	02 30
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
First attempt at compiling: There was one error and it was that I had an unidentified variable.
	This happened because I forgot that I had changed the variables and forgot to change that one accordingly.
It took about 8 more times to compile and to get it to work how it was supposed to
For a large majority of the time, I would get compile errors
When it would compile (before it worked properly) I would get a runtime error of
"....(Core Dumped)"
================================================================
Start Part 2
Estimated Time	01 30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
My plan is to copy the file over from chart1.c and google ways to solve chart 2 properly.
The way it will be tested will be keep running the program until the formatting looks the same.
Complete
Actual Time	00 30
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Everytime I compiled the file, there were no errors.  I had to keep compiling because I kept having
to change the justification of the numbers.
