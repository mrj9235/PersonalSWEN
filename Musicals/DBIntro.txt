Part 2

Review all of part 2 and record your estimate in the activity journal.

From this point forward, you may use either sqlite3 from the command line or the SQL Manager add-on to Firefox

Insert two new musicals, with their authors and the proper linkage. The musicals are:

Music Man	1957	Meredith Wilson
Hello, Dolly!	1964	Jerry Herman
Hello, Dolly!	1964	Michael Steward

What SQL commands were executed to completely insert the information for Music Man?

[Your commands here.]

Create a new table called Actresses with an auto-increment primary key id (integer) and the actress’s name (a string). Populate the table with the following actresses:
Carol Channing
Pearl Bailey
Shirley Jones
Julie Andrews
Audrey Hepburn

Record your process and observations in the activity journal.

End of Part 2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 3

Review all of part 3 and record your estimate in the activity journal.

Create a new linking table called "actresses_musicals" with two integer keys, actress_id and musical_id, and show the SQL command that was executed.

[Command here.]

Set up the following links between actresses and musicals in the actresses_musicals table:

Carol Channing	Hello, Dolly
Pearl Bailey	Hello, Dolly
Shirley Jones	Carousel
Audrey Hepburn	My Fair Lady
Julie Andrews	My Fair Lady
Julie Andrews	The Sound of Music

Finally, execute an SQL command to list the names of all the actresses who were ever in a play authored by Oscar Hammerstein. Note that this requires a join across all five tables in the database! Challenging, give it a try.

Record your process and observations in the activity journal.
