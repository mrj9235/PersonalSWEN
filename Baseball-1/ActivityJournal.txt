================================================================
Query 1: Find all the information on all the catchers (position 2) in the database
Estimated Time	00 15
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
My plan is to write it as best as possible and then run it until it works
Complete
Actual Time	00 15
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
It took a bit of time to actually figure out the syntax of the select statement.
But with enough looking at the powerpoint, I figured it out.

================================================================
Query 2: Find the name and age of all pitchers (position 1) on the Rays
Estimated Time	00 15
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
I plan on looking at the slides seeing how to write the command and then seeing if the output matched
Complete
Actual Time	00 30
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

This one ended up taking a bit longer because i forgot a single comma so it wasn't
printing at all

================================================================
Query 3: Find the name, number, and team of all outfielders (positions 7 through 9) who are 25 years old or younger
Estimated Time	00 15
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
I plan on implementing then checking to see if the output matched
Complete
Actual Time	00 15
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

The one thing that is still messing me up is the syntax of what section should have a comma and which one should
be seperated with and.  eventually I got it but that was the main issue I had here.

================================================================
Query 4: Find the name and number of all infielders (positions 3 through 6) on the Red Sox
Estimated Time	00 10
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
I plan on doing the same as before, writing it and seeing if it matches the output
Complete
Actual Time	00 05
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

I finally got the hang of the syntax, this one I was able to write and run without a problem.

================================================================
Query 5: Find the name, number, and team of all pitchers who are over 30 years old
Estimated Time	00 05 
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
Same as before

Complete
Actual Time	00 05
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)

Again I was able to write this pretty easily, was able to finish it in a decent amount of time.

================================================================
